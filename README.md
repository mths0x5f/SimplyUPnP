SimplyUPnP
==========

Up to this point, SimplyUPnP is just a little piece of code capable of finding UPnP devices, through SSDP protocol.

UPnP is a huge standard, full of details, so any kind of contribution is welcome. Take a look on the [official specifications][1] for ideas.

License
-------

SimplyUPnP is licensed under LGPL v3, which means, in short, that you:

* **have to** make *this* and *derivate* source code available (except when is for **private use only**),
* **shouldn't** embed and/or copy *this* and *derivate* source code in your software (otherwise, you **have to** make your whole code public), and
* **can** use *this* in your proprietary project as long that you observe the rules above.

(Please, note this list **DOES NOT** override the license text).

Anyway, I doubt you would like to use this on current stage.

The branches
------------

**development** branch is for the code in progress that shouldn't be used on production and **master** branch is for the most recent stable release (I hope someday).
